🛒 Retail Demand Forecasting & Replenishment Analytics
📌 Overview
Built an end-to-end demand forecasting and inventory optimisation pipeline inspired by UK grocery retail operations.
The objective was not only to improve forecast accuracy, but to quantify operational impact on:
* Stock availability

* Stockout cost

* Inventory holding cost

* Service level
🎯 Business Problem
In grocery retail, inaccurate forecasts lead to:
   * Lost sales during peak trading

   * Excess working capital tied in inventory

   * Reduced on-shelf availability

This project evaluates whether machine learning can outperform standard retail heuristics and deliver measurable inventory improvements.
🧠 Approach
1️⃣ Time-Series Feature Engineering
      * Lag features (1, 2, 4, 12, 52 weeks)

      * Rolling means and volatility

      * Calendar features

      * Holiday and pre-holiday indicators

      * Store metadata and economic signals

Chronological train-validation split was used to prevent leakage.


2️⃣ Benchmarking Against Retail Heuristics
Compared ML models against:
         * Last-week sales (lag_1)

         * Same-week-last-year (lag_52)

         * Rolling average

Baseline MAE ≈ 1751
RandomForest MAE ≈ 1395
~20% improvement.
Holiday MAE improved by ~25%.
3️⃣ Interpretability (SHAP)
SHAP analysis showed:
            * Annual seasonality (lag_52) dominates demand.

            * Short-term momentum (lag_1) is secondary.

            * Promotional markdown variables had limited marginal impact.

This confirms strong recurring demand cycles aligned to retail calendar events.


📦 Replenishment Simulation
To connect forecasting with operations, a weekly order-up-to policy was simulated.
